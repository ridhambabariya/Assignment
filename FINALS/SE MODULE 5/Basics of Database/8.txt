What is SQL Key Constraints? writing an Example of SQL Key Constraints

Ans.---> SQL key constraints are rules applied to columns or sets of columns in a database table to enforce data integrity and define relationships between tables. These constraints ensure that data stored in the database remains consistent and accurate
The main types of key constraints in SQL are :
1.Primary Key Constraint : A primary key constraint uniquely identifies each record or row in a table
e.x. --->
CREATE TABLE Employees(
    EmployeeID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FirstName VARCHAR(50),
    LastName VARCHAR(50),
    DepartmentID INT
);

2.Foreign Key Constraint : A foreign key constraint establishes a relationship between two tables by enforcing reference integrity so basically it works on the concept of parent and child relation.
e.x. --->
CREATE TABLE Orders(
    OrderID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ProductID INT,
    CustomerID INT,
    Quantity INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (ProductID) REFERENCES Products(ProductID),
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID)
);
