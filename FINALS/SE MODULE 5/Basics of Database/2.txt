What is Normalization?

Ans. ---> Normalization in databases is the process of organizing data to minimize data redundancy and improve data integrity.It involves structuring a database into tables and defining relationships between tables.

Normalization is very important so that same information not get stored and data remain consistent so that we can iprove the data integrity

1.First Normal Form (1NF):
    Ensure each table column has indivisible values.
    Ensure each record is unique.
2.Second Normal Form (2NF):
    All the functionalities of 1NF.
    Remove data that applies to multiple rows and put it in separate tables.
    Use foreign keys to link these tables.
3.Third Normal Form (3NF):
    All the functionalities of 2NF.
    Remove columns that are not dependent on the primary key.
