What is trigger and how to create a Trigger in SQL?

In SQL, a trigger is a database object associated with a table that automatically executes a set of SQL statements like insert, update, delete etc....

Syntax : 
CREATE TRIGGER trigger1
{BEFORE | AFTER}
{INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE}
ON EMPLOYEES
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    //SQL statements to be executed//
END;

e.x.--->
CREATE TRIGGER UPDATE_TIMESTAMP
AFTER UPDATE ON EMPLOYEES
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    UPDATE EMPLOYEES
    SET LAST_UPDATED = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
    WHERE EID = NEW.EID;
END;
