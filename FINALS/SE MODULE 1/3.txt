 What is SDLC? Explain each phase of SDLC

Ans. ---> The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a systematic process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying information systems. The SDLC aims to produce high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates, and works effectively and efficiently in the current and planned information technology infrastructure.

Planning: Define project scope and usability.
Requirements Analysis: Gather and validate requirements.
Design: Create system and component designs.
Implementation (Coding): Write and integrate code.
Testing: Validate functionality and identify defects.
Deployment: Deliver and install the software.
Maintenance: Provide ongoing support and updates.
Understanding each phase of the SDLC helps in managing and executing software projects more effectively, ensuring high quality and reliability of the final product.
